-Picross

The goal is to create an app where a user can fill in a picross

-GUI

A 10x10 grid where the user can fill in the picross
Help numbers to the left and top of the grid(the width/height should depend on how many helpnumbers there are)
A submit button for entering your solution(below it will be shown below if correct/wrong)
Achievemts page(achievements should be stored locally in the cache)

-HelpNumbers

Each row have a set of help numbers which are stored in a 2d array, these should be TD cells, perhaps a 2d array where each element is a helpnumber(this is to make sure that there can be grids larger then 10x10)

-Submit button

A simple button to check if solution is correct

-Creating a new picross

Admins should be able to create a new picross, this feature should be on a seperate url(nothing confidential will be stored here)
This tool should generate the help numbers
